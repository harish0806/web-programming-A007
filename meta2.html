<h2>METAPHYSICAL-NIHILISM</h2>
<p><i>Metaphysical nihilism is the philosophical theory that there might have<br>
been no objects at allâ€”that is, that there is a possible world in which there are no<br> 
objects at all; or at least that there might have been no concrete objects at all,<br>
so that even if every possible world contains some objects, there is at least one <br>
that contains only abstract objects.<br></i></p>
<h2>For more details on metaphysical nihilism,you can download research work

<p><b><i>One of the most expressive and fascinating was was expressing thoughts<br>
is writing poetry.This helps to express the philosophical ideology and thoughts<br>
in an interesting and beautiful way.<br></i></b></p>

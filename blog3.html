<h1>QUESTION MARK?</h1>
<p>My mental state is confused, looking for answers my<br> mind has questioned;<br>
If there is a superior entity,is it the one the holy<br> book has mentioned?<br>
<br>
My parents take me to temples, tell me to join hands,<br> bow and pray;<br>
I wonder if the statue that stands,holds the entity with<br> a positive ray?<br>
<br>
Every religion has different god, every caste does too;<br>
Sometimes i wonder, wasn't this convenient for book creators to do?<br>
<br>
The gods in the book belong to different caste and <br>also different religion;<br>
I wonder, what's the difference then, if humans do<br> the same stupid division?<br>
<br>
There is always a big question mark,when i close<br> my eyes and bow;<br>
I would like to connect to the superior entity, but the question is how?<br>
<br>

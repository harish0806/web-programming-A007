<h1> TRUTH OF A LIE </h1>
<p><b>
People think life is a test,full of joy and sorrow;<br>
But they fail to see the bigger picture, the bitter<br> truth of tomorrow.<br>
<br>
People are self-centered, think their troubles is all that matter;<br>
They end up using other humans, shitting on their feelings even if they shatter.<br>
<br>
Humans killing humans, in the name of religion and god;<br>
Little do they know, the interpretation is done by a fraud.<br>
<br>
Islam lead some people to terrorism, Geeta lead to castes in religion;<br>
Humans are a single race, religion is just an illusion.<br>
<br>
People pray for their selfish reasons,begging to god on their knees;<br>
Universe is so vast and huge,prayers insignificant as unused keys.<br>
<br>
These thoughts just flooded in, and caught me low when i was happy and high;<br>
But somewhere i was glad to know, human existence is such a lie.<br></b>

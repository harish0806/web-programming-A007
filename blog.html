      <h1> ISLAND</h1>
      <p>The sand, the forest and the ocean around, oh my it seems so beautiful;
Nature's beauty offers you comfort, but soon it turns so awful.</p>

<p>The forest is so beautiful, seems like nature is at its best;
Well it's too violent in reality,heart beats racing inside your chest.</p>

<p>The ocean seems so blue as a pearl, the waves running to the shore;
When thirst leaves you all high and dry, the ocean gives no escape door.</p>

<p>The island looks so fantastic and great, a perfect looking place;
However you don't realize the pain and violence, the island withholds inside the closed case.</p>

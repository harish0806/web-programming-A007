      <h1><b>ISLAND</b></h1>
      <h3><i><p>The sand, the forest and the ocean around, oh my it seems<br/>
             so beautiful;<br/>
             Nature's beauty offers you comfort, but soon it turns<br/>
             so awful.</p>

          <p>The forest is so beautiful, seems like nature is at<br/>
             its best;<br/>
             Well it's too violent in reality,heart beats racing<br/>
             inside your chest.</p>

          <p>The ocean seems so blue as a pearl, the waves running<br/>
              to the shore;<br/>
             When thirst leaves you all high and dry, the ocean gives<br/>
             no escape door.</p>

          <p>The island looks so fantastic and great, a perfect<br/>
             looking place;<br/>
             However you don't realize the pain and violence, the island<br/>
            withholds inside the closed case.</p></i></h3>

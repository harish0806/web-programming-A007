  <head><h1>METAPHYSICAL POETRY</h1></head>
  <body>DEFINITION:<br>You've probably heard of haikus, lyrical poems and limericks.<br> 
    All of those types of poetry have specific qualities that allow us to group them<br> together. 
    Metaphysical poetry is a little bit different. The poems classified in this group<br> 
    do share common characteristics: they are all highly intellectualized, use<br> rather
    strange imagery, use frequent paradox and contain extremely<br> complicated thought</body>

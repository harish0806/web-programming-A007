    <h1>METAPHYSICAL POETRY<br></h1>
    <h2>DEFINITION:</h2><p><i>You've probably heard of haikus, lyrical poems and limericks.<br> 
    All of those types of poetry have specific qualities that allow us to group them<br> together. 
    Metaphysical poetry is a little bit different. The poems classified in this group<br> 
    do share common characteristics: they are all highly intellectualized, use<br> rather
    strange imagery, use frequent paradox and contain extremely<br> complicated thought</i>
    <br><br><b>According to me as an individual,the philosohical questions arised in an individual<br>about reality
    and existence comes from the bases of NIHILISM.</b><br></p>
    <h1>NIHILISM</h1>
   <p> Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be<br> known or communicated.
    It is often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that<br> condemns existence. 
    A true nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties,<br> and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy.</p>
